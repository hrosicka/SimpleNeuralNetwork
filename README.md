# Simple Neural Network

This repository contains a simple feedforward neural network implemented in Python using the NumPy library. The network has one hidden layer and utilizes the sigmoid activation function.

## Overview

The `SimpleNeuralNetwork` class provides a basic implementation of a neural network suitable for learning simple patterns. It includes methods for initialization, forward propagation, backward propagation, training, and prediction.

## Installation

No specific installation is required as the code relies only on the NumPy library. Ensure you have NumPy installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
